# Bike Demand Prediction using Multiple Linear Regression

## Project Overview  
This project involves building a **Multiple Linear Regression** model to predict the demand for shared bikes. The dataset consists of rental data from **BoomBikes**, a US-based bike-sharing service. The company aims to analyze key factors affecting bike demand to make data-driven business decisions and recover revenue post-COVID-19.  

## Problem Statement  
BoomBikes has collected **daily rental data** across various environmental and seasonal conditions. The goal is to:  
1. **Identify significant variables** affecting bike demand.  
2. **Understand how these factors impact demand fluctuations.**  
3. **Build a predictive model** to help the company optimize business operations and resource allocation.  

## Approach & Methodology  
The project is structured into the following steps:  
1. **Data Understanding & Exploration**  
   - Load and inspect the dataset  
   - Check for missing values and data types  

2. **Data Visualization**  
   - Explore trends, correlations, and patterns  
   - Visualize the impact of different variables on bike demand  

3. **Data Preparation**  
   - Encode categorical variables  
   - Normalize/scale numerical features  
   - Handle missing values (if any)  

4. **Model Building & Evaluation**  
   - Implement **Multiple Linear Regression**  
   - Evaluate model performance using **R², Adjusted R², RMSE, and residual analysis**  
   - Interpret results and identify key factors  

## Dataset Description  
The dataset includes the following key features:  
- **Temporal Features**: Season, Year, Month, Weekday, Holiday, Working Day  
- **Weather Conditions**: Temperature, Humidity, Windspeed  
- **Operational Factors**: Casual and registered users, total count of rented bikes  

## Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels  
- **Tool**: Jupyter Notebook
