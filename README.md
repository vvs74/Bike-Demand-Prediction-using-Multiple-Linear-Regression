Bike Sharing Demand Prediction – Multiple Linear Regression
Project Overview

This project involves building a Multiple Linear Regression model to predict the demand for shared bikes. The objective is to help BoomBikes, a bike-sharing service provider in the U.S., understand the factors affecting bike demand and develop data-driven strategies to enhance business growth post-COVID-19.

Problem Statement

BoomBikes has observed a decline in revenue due to the COVID-19 pandemic. To recover and grow, they need to predict bike demand based on various factors such as weather conditions, time of the year, and user behavior. This model will help the company identify key variables influencing demand and optimize their operational strategy.

Business Objective

Identify the key factors that impact bike demand.
Develop a predictive model using Multiple Linear Regression.
Help the company align resources and optimize pricing to meet demand.
Dataset

The dataset consists of various features related to bike-sharing demand, including:

Temporal Features: Season, Year, Month, Weekday, Holiday, Working Day
Weather Conditions: Temperature, Humidity, Windspeed
Operational Factors: Casual and registered users, total count of rented bikes
